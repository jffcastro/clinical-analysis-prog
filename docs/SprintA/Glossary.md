| **Administrator** | **Administrador** | A person responsible for carrying out the administration of a business or organization. |
| **Algorithm** | **Algoritmo** | A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some end. |
| **Application** | **Aplicação** | A program that performs a particular task or set of tasks. |
| **Asymptotic Behavior** | **Comportamento Assintótico** | The asymptotic behavior of sequences of random variables – that is, the behavior of infinitely long sequences of random variables – is an involved mathematical concept but it has important implications for the statistical analysis of data from large samples. |
| **Benchmark Algorithm** | **Algoritmo de Referência** | In statistical learning benchmarking is the methodology of comparing learners or algorithms with respect to a certain performance measure. |
| **Brute-Force Algorithm** | **Algoritmo de Força Bruta** | In computer science, brute-force search or exhaustive search, also known as generate and test, is a very general problem-solving technique and algorithmic paradigm that consists of systematically enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking whether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement. |
| **Centers** | **Centros** | The point from which an activity or process is directed, or on which it is focused. |
| **Client** | **Cliente** | A person served by or utilizing the services of a social agency. |
| **Computational Complexity** | **Complexidade Computacional** | In computer science, the computational complexity or simply complexity of an algorithm is the amount of resources required to run it. Particular focus is given to time and memory requirements.|
| **Contiguous** | **Contíguo** | Being in actual contact : touching along a boundary or at a point. |
| **Coordinator** | **Coordenador** | A person whose job is to organize events or activities and to negotiate with others in order to ensure they work together effectively. |
| **Default** | **Predefinição** | A preselected option adopted by a computer program or other mechanism when no alternative is specified by the user or programmer. |
| **Employee** | **Funcionário** | A person employed for wages or salary, especially at non-executive level. |
| **FIFO Queue** | **Fila FIFO** | A FIFO queue is a queue that operates on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. This means that the request (like a customer in a store or a print job sent to a printer) is processed in the order in which it arrives. |
| **GHD** | **DGS** | Acronym for _General Health Directorate_.|
| **GRHC** | **AGES** | Acronym for _Groupings of Health Centers_.|
| **NHS** | **SNS** | Acronym for _National Health Service_.|
| **Nurse** | **Enfermeira** | A person skilled or trained in caring for sick or injured people. |
| **Outbreak** | **Surto** | A sudden rise in the incidence of a disease. |
| **Perfomance** | **Desempenho** | The execution of an action. |
| **RHA** | **ARS** | Acronym for _Regional Health Administration_.|
| **Receptionist** | **Rececionista** | A receptionist is an employee taking an office or administrative support position.|
| **SMS** | **SMS** | Acronym for _Short Message Service_. |
| **Slot** | **Intervalo** | A time when something can happen or is planned to happen, especially when it is one of several possible times.|
| **System** | **Sistema** | A group of devices or artificial objects or an organization forming a network especially for distributing something or serving a common purpose. |
| **Time Complexity** | **Complexidade Temporal** | Time complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm.|
| **User** | **Utilizador** | A person who uses or operates something. |
| **Vaccine** | **Vacina** | A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins.|
